The app was built using create-react-native-app (React Native & Expo).

There was a short time frame to build the app, so I wasn't able to get as much working as I hoped. One tradeoff was that I used the openweathermaps icons instead of the CSS based icons suggested. Another, was that I hard coded a list of beginning cities, that would be loaded from AsyncStorage or similar. 

Again, this was a WIP, and I hope you can see the direction I was heading.

To run:
  clone code
  cd into dir and run yarn
  yarn start

  I ran the code on my device using the 'e' option.
